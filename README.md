# Emerging Markets GDP Growth Analysis (2010–2023)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the GDP growth trends of five major emerging markets — India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, and Turkey — over the period 2010–2023. The project also forecasts GDP growth for 2024–2026 using basic regression modeling.

**Skills Demonstrated**:
- Data gathering and cleaning (World Bank data)
- Time series visualization
- Growth rate calculation
- Predictive modeling using Linear Regression
- Interpretation of economic trends

This project simulates the tasks required in emerging market investment research, such as macroeconomic data evaluation, visualization, and insight generation.

## Data Source
- [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for Linear Regression)

## Key Steps
1. Load GDP data for selected countries.
2. Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. Visualize GDP trends over time.
4. Calculate annual GDP growth rates.
5. Forecast GDP for 2024–2026 using simple Linear Regression models.
6. Summarize key insights.

## Insights Summary
- **India** showed the most consistent GDP growth during 2010–2023.
- **Brazil** and **South Africa** experienced GDP volatility due to political and commodity market shocks.
- **Indonesia** showed stable and moderate growth.
- **Turkey** had rapid growth followed by significant volatility in the last few years.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```
2. Run the `emerging_markets_gdp_analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate other macro indicators like Inflation, Debt-to-GDP ratio.
- Use ARIMA or Prophet models for better GDP forecasting.
